# Nietzsche Character-Level Text Prediction – Session 13 🧠📜

This notebook demonstrates character-level prediction on a philosophical excerpt using a trained deep learning model. The text is likely drawn from Nietzsche's *Twilight of the Idols* or *Beyond Good and Evil*, and the model attempts to complete phrases such as:

> "That which does not kill us makes us str..."

## 🔍 Key Features
- Uses a trained character-level model to predict next characters
- Implements top-N prediction and recursive generation
- Applies preprocessing and sequence slicing for inference
- Explores philosophical phrase completion with multiple outputs
